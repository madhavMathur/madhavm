      <h2>Systems thinking with product empathy.</h2>
      <p>
        I care about architecture, but I also care about whether the architecture makes life easier for engineers,
        product teams, and customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my work sits at the boundary of backend reliability, API design, and execution discipline: good docs,
        clean contracts, and fewer surprises in production.

        Outside engineering, I am drawn to writing, architecture, and design craft. This site is where those threads meet.
